this file is my reading pof Pro GIT book
there is one more file about git process in ftlinux
version control : system that records changes to a file or set of files overtime
so that you can recall specific versions later.
centralised version control system:one developer should collaborate with developers 
on other systems so for this cvcs is used .example : subversion and perforce.

Distributed version control systems:
example : git
in a dvcs clients dont just check out the latest snapshot of the files : they fully mirror
the repository

working with remotes:
remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the internet or network somewhere

branching :
branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without
messing with that main line .


lets start with example:

git add a1 a2 a3
git commit -m 'example'

now 
When you create the commit by running git commit, Git checksums each
subdirectory (in this case, just the root project directory) and stores those tree
objects in the Git repository. Git then creates a commit object that has the metadata and a pointer to the root project tree so it can re-create that snapshot
when needed.
Your Git repository now contains five objects: one blob for the contents of
each of your three files, one tree that lists the contents of the directory and
specifies which file names are stored as which blobs, and one commit with the
pointer to that root tree and all the commit metadata.

check pg 82 of ProGIT for clear diagram .(or read the book full  if you are curious)

If you make some changes and commit again, the next commit stores a
pointer to the commit that came immediately before it.


A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits,
youâ€™re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every
time you commit, it moves forward automatically.


to delete branch
$ git branch -d hotfix
Deleted branch hotfix (3a0874c).
