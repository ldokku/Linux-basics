redhat package manager
it is used to bind all software related source codes,configurations files and meta data in one file called rpm(refer linux bible book)

two things are important while installing packages what are they?(find it in linux bible)
To make package installation more convenient  they created YUM facility
yum is used to solve the headache of dependencies.
with yum the problem of dependencies is solved and bared by linux distribution
if a package needs dependency package ,it finds it in the predefined location for directory or repository .
the locations of these repositories would then be stored on the users system in the etc/yum.repos.d directory
how yum works 
yum [options] command
ex: yum install firefox
